## Student Academic Performance & Teaching Analytics

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on transforming raw academic data into a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to monitor educational quality for a cohort of 457 students. By leveraging data visualization, the project identifies student performance trends and evaluates teaching effectiveness across various modules.

📊 Key Insights & Features
Subject Segmentation Matrix (Scatter Plot): Classifies modules into four quadrants (e.g., "Difficult" or "High Differentiation") based on Mean Scores and Standard Deviation to identify areas needing academic intervention.
Grade Distribution Analysis: Provides a clear breakdown of student performance, identifying that 24.9% of students achieved "Excellent" status.
Teaching Performance Comparison: Benchmarks average student grades across different instructors (e.g., TS. Phùng Thế Bảo, TS. Nguyễn Tuấn Anh) to ensure grading consistency and teaching quality.
Dynamic Interactive Reporting: Built-in slicers for "Class Name" and "Subject Name" allow users to perform instant deep-dives into specific academic groups.

🛠 Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop: For data modeling and visualization.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To calculate complex metrics like Standard Deviation and dynamic rankings.
Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation of raw academic records.
Microsoft Excel: As the primary data source.
